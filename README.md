manifold Omnibus project
========================
This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for
`manifold`!

### Supported Package Platforms

* Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64
* CentOS 7.5 x86_64 (other RHEL7 derivatives should work, but have not been tested)
* macOS (provisional, not intended for production use).

Installation
------------
You must have a sane Ruby 2.0.0+ environment with Bundler installed. Ensure all
the required gems are installed:

```shell
$ bundle install --binstubs
```

For building other platforms on macOS, you must also have [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
installed alongside [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). This will build `rpm` and `deb`
packages in a virtualized environment.

Usage
-----
### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus build manifold
```

The platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform
where the `build project` command is invoked. For example, running this command
on a MacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X package. After the build completes
packages will be available in the `pkg/` folder.

#### Vagrant

To build packages in vagrant, use the following strategies. While provisioning
the machines, a warning may display about vagrant failing to connect to the
machine while it is waiting for it to bootâ€”this will resolve itself without
need to intervene.

The build steps will take a while depending on your host architecture
& performance; you may want to grab a drink. Once the build is finished,
the compiled packages will appear in the `pkg` folder on the _host_.

##### CentOS 7

```shell
vagrant up centos7-builder
bin/rake build:centos7
```

##### Ubuntu 16

```shell
vagrant up ubuntu16-builder
bin/rake build:ubuntu16
```

##### Ubuntu 18

```shell
vagrant up ubuntu18-builder
bin/rake build:ubuntu18
```


### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with
the `clean` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean manifold
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the
build including the project install directory (`/opt/manifold`) and
the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean manifold --purge
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the
`help` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus help
```

Version Manifest
----------------

Git-based software definitions may specify branches as their
default_version. In this case, the exact git revision to use will be
determined at build-time unless a project override (see below) or
external version manifest is used.  To generate a version manifest use
the `omnibus manifest` command:

```
omnibus manifest PROJECT -l warn
```

This will output a JSON-formatted manifest containing the resolved
version of every software definition.
